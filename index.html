<h1 style="clear:both;">The MonoTable Data Structure</h1>
<quote>"Everything should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler." -Einstein</quote>
<p>MonoTable stores all data in a single table. The table consists of records sorted by their keys.
Each record, in addition to their key, can have 0 or more named fields. Basicaly, it's a
2-dimensional hash where the first dimension supports range selects.

<h1>Many User-Tables in the MonoTable</h1>
<p>The MonoTable can be easily broken up into multiple "virtual-tables" by
prefixing all keys in a virtual-table with it's name: table1/keyA,
table2/keyZeta. MonoTable was designed to efficiently support this use-case. Keys are allowed to be large and common prefexes are stored efficiently.

<h1>Easily Scalable</h1>
<p>Most NoSQL options claim to be scalable, but in fact most are not or at least are not easilly scalable. Monotable is designed to be scalable along each
of the core metrics: reads/s, writes/s, and total data-size. Further, Monotable is designed to be "realtime" scalable. You can scale without ever taking the system offline.
<p>Scaling is easy. Fire up another server. Point it at the Monotable cluster. Done.
<p>The only practical limit for Monotable is the maximum record size (typically 32 megabytes). Otherwise there are <b>no limits</b>:
<ul class="bullets">
  <li>Maximum # of records: <b>none</b>
  <li>Maximum # of servers: <b>none</b>
  <li>Maximum # of bytes stored: <b>none</b>
</ul>

<h1>Easy to Admin</h1>
<ul class="bullets">
  <li>Number of daemons/server: <b>1</b>
  <li>Number of server types in cluster: <b>1</b>
  <li>Single points of failure: <b>none</b>
  <li>Automatic server failure recovery
  <li>Automatic data corruption detection and recovery
  <li>Automatic load balancing
  <li>Data structure designed for easy manual recovery in the worst-case scenario
</ul>


<h1>Competitive Survey</h1>
<ul class="bullets">
<li><b>Hadoop:</b> Complex to config and admin. NameNode - single point of failure, both for serving and data integrity. Scalability limited by NameNode memory.
<li><b>Cassandra:</b> No data-locality. Limited map-reduce due to unsorted data. Difficult to add and remove nodes.
<li><b>CouchDB:</b> Data scaling only via manual sharding.
</ul>

<h1>Future</h1>
Once we get V1 down, we'd like to add support for a Map-Reduce. The core data-structure is designed to work well with Map-Reduce.
